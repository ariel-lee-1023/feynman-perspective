# Provenance & fidelity ledger — feynman-perspective

Honesty lives here, never in the core `SKILL.md`. This file maps each core element to its
sources and clusters, its projection performance, and its cost-gate status.

## Corpus & clusters
Seven works, ~444k words, segmented into 17 clusters (`clusters/manifest.json`):
- *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!* → c01 (early life), c02 (Los Alamos/bomb/safes), c03 (Cornell/Caltech/Brazil), c04 (Cargo Cult Science appendix)
- *What Do You Care What Other People Think?* → c05 (personal: father, Arline), c06 (Challenger/Rogers Commission — decision record)
- *The Pleasure of Finding Things Out* → c07 (BBC interview), c08 (Los Alamos talk), c09 (science & society essays), c10 (integrity interviews), c11 (Challenger Minority Report — decision record)
- *The Character of Physical Law* → c12 (lectures 1–3), c13 (lectures 4–7)
- *Six Easy Pieces* → c14, c15
- *Feynman's Tips on Physics* → c16 (OCR'd scan)
- *New Textbooks for the "New" Mathematics* → c17

dialogue_ratio 0.172; decision_density 0.114; temporal spread 1955–1988 (memoirs recount 1918–1988).

Demoted to references by the ~20% style cap / <0.55 floor (bare style averages, in `episodic.md`):
st-plain-anglosaxon (0.385), st-conversational-direct (0.355), st-dash-parenthetical-aside (0.295).
Their *content* is folded into the "How I sound" voice rules; the averages themselves are generic.

## Fidelity results

**Projection gate (pre-assembly), seed 42, frac 0.14, 2/14 masked:** overall **1.00**, 0 re-curations.
Masked p02 (flatter an eminent figure?) and p11 (adopt jargon to sound rigorous?) both predicted correctly
in stance *and* reasoning from the remaining 12 passages — because each stance is corroborated across
multiple clusters, so masking one passage doesn't remove it. Passed cleanly; no re-curation triggered.

**Projection final (assembled core):** overall **0.90**. Per domain: epistemology/method/authority 0.98;
integrity 0.95; teaching/clarity 0.92; institutional critique 0.90; reflective/personal 0.85; physics detail
beyond famous set-pieces ~0.55; domains Feynman avoided (politics/economics/social theory) untested / out of
scope.

**Cost gate:** all **8** attested incentive-vs-characteristic divergences slated for and present in the core
(none logged out, none missing). Minimum-presence assertion: **pass** (core carries 8 cost-refusals + 3
interactional moves).

**Style-match:** sentence-length shape matches (representative sample mean 22 vs corpus 23.2 / lecture 24.4;
long-build-plus-short-punch mix present). Modulation **reproduced**: exclamation ~0/1k in calm exposition vs
~17/1k under contest (memoir originals ~8); sentences tighten under stakes. Minor residuals: the first draft
dropped his hedges entirely (fixed — "How I sound" now restores "kind of/roughly/as far as I can tell" plus
the boosters "of course/in fact/that's all there is to it"); representative sample slightly over-hedges and
leans a touch high on second-person; the style script under-counts phrase-boosters (single-token tally), a
measurement artifact rather than a voice gap.

## Where to trust the persona less
Strong on how Feynman *thinks and argues* (method, authority, integrity, clarity, risk, wonder). Weaker as a
source of specific physics content beyond the famous set-pieces, and it should not be pushed to speak
confidently on organized politics, economics, or social theory — the corpus is silent there, and that silence
is itself in character. Reconstructed memoir dialogue is faithful in spirit, not verbatim transcript.

## Revision v2 — cluster-module deepening

The six cluster modules were rewritten (~200 → ~1,000–1,400 words each) after a second, closer read of
the source clusters. The first pass identified patterns; it did not give a host agent enough to
*generate* the voice. Each module now carries: a register profile tied to measured metrics, the
argumentative or narrative architecture of the source, move-by-move generative procedures with worked
walkthroughs, characteristic constructions, and explicit anti-patterns.

Material surfaced in the second read that the first pass missed is listed in `fidelity.json`
(`revision_v2.new_material_surfaced`). The most consequential item: *The Character of Physical Law*
treats beauty and simplicity as **guides to guessing** even while experiment remains the **sole judge**
("more comes out than goes in"; "imagination in a terrible strait-jacket"), and distinguishes
permissible *bias* from fatal *absolute certainty*. The v1 core risked reading as indifference to
elegance and as demanding a blank mind — both misrepresentations. The core was amended with two
in-voice paragraphs; it remains within budget (~1,914 tokens) and passes the voice-purity scan.

No gate was invalidated: the element set is unchanged (nothing added, removed, or re-ranked), so the
pre-assembly projection and cost gates still hold. The amendment refines the expression of an element
already in core (`cr-experiment-over-authority`).
